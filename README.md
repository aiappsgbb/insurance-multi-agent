# Contoso Claims - Multi-Agent Insurance Claims Platform

An **Agentic AI Claims Demo** powered by advanced multi-agent systems leveraging **Langgraph** and **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4.1)**, designed to streamline and enhance the end-to-end insurance claims process. This proof-of-concept showcases a cutting-edge architecture in which specialized AI agents collaboratively assess claims, delivering instant, transparent, and explainable recommendations directly to claims processors. By augmenting human decision-making, the solution significantly accelerates claim handling—reducing processing time from hours to minutes—while enhancing consistency, transparency, and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 What This Demo Showcases

### Multi-Agent Architecture
Unlike traditional single-model AI systems, Contoso Claims employs a **collaborative multi-agent approach** where specialized AI agents work together:

- **🔍 Claim Assessor Agent** - Analyzes damage photos, evaluates repair costs, and validates claim consistency
- **📋 Policy Checker Agent** - Verifies coverage terms, searches policy documents, and determines claim eligibility  
- **⚠️ Risk Analyst Agent** - Detects fraud patterns, analyzes claimant history, and assesses risk factors
- **📧 Communication Agent** - Generates personalized customer emails and requests missing documentation
- **👨‍💼 Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates the workflow and synthesizes final recommendations

### Agent Behaviors & Capabilities

#### Claim Assessor
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Processes damage photos using Azure OpenAI LLMs with vision Capabilities
- **Cost Validation**: Cross-references repair estimates with vehicle specifications
- **Documentation Review**: Evaluates completeness of supporting evidence
- **Damage Assessment**: Provides detailed analysis of incident consistency

#### Policy Checker  
- **Coverage Verification**: Searches policy documents using semantic similarity
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles both English and Dutch insurance policies
- **Exclusion Analysis**: Identifies policy limitations and coverage gaps
- **Intelligent Search**: Uses vector embeddings for accurate policy matching

#### Risk Analyst
- **Fraud Detection**: Analyzes patterns indicative of fraudulent claims
- **History Analysis**: Reviews claimant's previous claim patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Provides quantitative risk assessments
- **Red Flag Identification**: Highlights suspicious claim elements

#### Communication Agent
- **Personalized Messaging**: Crafts contextual customer communications
- **Missing Document Requests**: Generates specific requests for additional evidence
- **Professional Tone**: Maintains appropriate insurance industry language
- **Template Generation**: Creates reusable communication templates

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Multi-Agent Framework**: LangGraph with supervisor pattern
- **AI Provider**: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1) 
- **Backend**: FastAPI

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Agent Collaboration**: Watch agents work together in live workflows
- **Explainable AI**: Full transparency into agent reasoning and decision paths
- **Document Intelligence**: PDF processing and semantic search across policies
- **Multimodal Processing**: Image analysis for damage assessment
- **Interactive Demos**: Individual agent testing and complete workflow simulation
- **Production Ready**: Deployed on Azure with enterprise security

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management
- Azure OpenAI account (optional - falls back to mock responses)


### Environment Configuration

Authentication uses **Entra ID** (Azure AD) — no API keys needed.

**Local development** — just sign in with the Azure CLI:
```bash
az login
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=llm-deployment-name(ex. gpt-4.1)
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=embedding-model-deployment-name
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-04-01-preview
```

> **Note:** Your Azure AD user must have the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role
> on the Azure OpenAI resource. Assign it with:
> ```bash
> az role assignment create \
>   --assignee <your-user-object-id> \
>   --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \
>   --scope /subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<aoai-name>
> ```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
uv run fastapi dev
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000


## 🌐 Azure Deployment

### Prerequisites
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/)
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions

### Deploy to Azure Container Apps
```bash
# Login to Azure
azd auth login

# Set required environment variables
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_ID /subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<name>

# Initialize and deploy
azd up
```

This will:
1. Create Azure Container Apps environment
2. Set up container registry with managed identity
3. Deploy both frontend and backend containers
4. Assign **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role to the managed identity on your AOAI resource (even if it's in a different resource group)
5. Configure networking and CORS policies
6. Output the deployed application URLs

### Infrastructure
The deployment creates:
- **Container Apps Environment** with consumption-based scaling
- **Azure Container Registry** for image storage
- **Managed Identity** for secure registry access
- **Log Analytics Workspace** for monitoring
- **HTTPS endpoints** with automatic SSL certificates

## 🎮 Demo Scenarios

### Individual Agent Testing
- `/agents/claim-assessor` to test damage photo analysis
- `/agents/policy-checker` to verify coverage scenarios
- `/agents/risk-analyst` for fraud detection demos
- `/agents/communication-agent` for email generation

### Complete Workflow
- Go to `/demo` for end-to-end claim processing
- Upload damage photos and watch multimodal analysis
- See agents collaborate in real-time
- Review final assessment with full reasoning

### Sample Claims
